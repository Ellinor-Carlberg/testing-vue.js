# testing-vue.js
This project is for learning the framework Vue.js.
The final files for my project are in the map "Vue project". This is the files you should look at. It is only the index.html file that have Vue.js coding.

The map "Files for learning" only have old files where I was trying out diffrent coding project with Vue.js.


#Guide for installing Vue.js

The easiest way to try out Vue.js is with a script tag. The script tag I choose is for prototyping or learning purposes. (You can also go to: 
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html and get more info or if you want to include Vue in your project in some other way.)


You create an index.html file and include Vue with:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>

You can put this script tag in your html.file inside the body tag. Then you write under it <script></script>, and inside this script tag you can try out vue.js coding.


Also if you want you can download the Vue Devtools extension:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools
(There is also a installation guide for the extension.)
